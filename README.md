# Task 4: Feature Encoding and Data Scaling

## Objective
Prepare the Adult Income dataset for machine learning by performing feature encoding and scaling.

## Dataset
Adult Income Dataset

## Steps Undertaken
- Distinguished between categorical and numerical features
- Used Label Encoding for ordinal categorical features
- Applied One-Hot Encoding for nominal categorical features
- Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler
- Examined the dataset before and after scaling
- Saved the preprocessed dataset for future use

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
The dataset is fully preprocessed and ready for use in machine learning models.

## Notes on Processed Dataset
The preprocessed CSV was generated within the notebook.  
Due to GitHub’s 25MB upload limit, the processed file is not included in the repository.
